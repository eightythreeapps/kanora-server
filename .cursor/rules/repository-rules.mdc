# Repositories
- Repositories should abstract database interactions → Prevent direct database queries in services.
- Use Prisma → Keep database logic separate from business logic.
- Return plain JavaScript objects → Avoid exposing ORM models outside of the repository.
- Ensure repositories are testable → Inject the database client as a dependency.
