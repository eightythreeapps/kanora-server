# Prisma ORM Rules

- Use UUIDs instead of auto-incremented IDs (@default(uuid())).
- Timestamps: createdAt and updatedAt should be used for tracking.
- Use environment variables for DATABASE_URL in .env.
- To avoid creating multiple Prisma clients, use a singleton pattern.
- Encapsulate DB logic in repositories. Prisma queries should ALWAYS be in repositories NOT in controllers. This makes it easier to reuse them across services.
- Use Seed data (prisma/seed.js) for test and dev environments if required. 
- When updating multiple records, use transactions to ensure consistency.
- Fetch only required fields for efficiency.
