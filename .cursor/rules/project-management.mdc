ðŸ†• Create
All work items must start as an issue with a clear title and description.
Use appropriate labels (e.g. feature, bug, tech-debt, discussion, blocked) and assign to a milestone if applicable.

ðŸ“Œ Plan
Issues must be added to the MCP board under the Backlog column.
During triage/planning meetings, promote issues to To Do when ready to be picked up.

ðŸš§ Work
Move issues from To Do â†’ In Progress when development begins.
A Pull Request (PR) must be linked to the issue.
All PRs should include the issue number in the title or body (Fixes #123).

âœ… Review
Move to Review when a PR is opened and ready for feedback.
A second contributor must approve the PR before merging (unless otherwise agreed).

ðŸš€ Done
After merging, move the issue to Done.
Close the issue only when the change is deployed or shipped (as agreed by the team).

ðŸ“Š Optional Enhancements
Use custom fields for priority, estimate, or owner if the MCP template supports it.
Link related issues (dependencies, epics) to maintain traceability.

ðŸ§¼ Rules of Thumb
No issue? No work.
One issue = one feature/fix/decision.
Keep board status in sync with actual progress.
Keep issues updated with comments or context shifts.
