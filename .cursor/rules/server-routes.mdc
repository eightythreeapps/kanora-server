# Routes
Keep route definitions separate → Define routes in routes/ and import them into app.ts.

The application should implement an API versioning system to more gracefully handle breaking changes. The /routes directory should have subdirectories for each API version (v1, v2) etc.

No other directories should implement this structure. 

├── /routes       # Route handlers
│   ├── /v1       # API Version 1
│   │   ├── auth.routes.ts
│   │   ├── users.routes.ts
│   ├── /v2       # API Version 2 (if needed)
│   │   ├── users.routes.ts
