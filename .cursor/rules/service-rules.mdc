# ServiceServices (Business Logic Layer)
- Services should contain business rules and orchestrate operations. They should NOT interact with HTTP requests or responses.
- Keep services independent of Express → This makes them easier to test.
- Use dependency injection → Pass repositories or external dependencies via constructors.
- Ensure services are stateless → No instance variables storing request-specific data.

Example User Service (src/application/services/UserService.ts)

```
import { UserRepository } from "../../infrastructure/repositories/UserRepository";

export class UserService {
  private userRepository: UserRepository;

  constructor(userRepository: UserRepository) {
    this.userRepository = userRepository;
  }

  async getUserById(userId: string) {
    return this.userRepository.findById(userId);
  }
}
```
